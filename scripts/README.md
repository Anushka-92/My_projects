🎯 YouTube Close Project
🚀 Introduction
I was feeling a bit distracted 😵‍💫, so I channeled that energy into creating this fun project! 🎉 The idea is simple: stop wasting time on YouTube and focus on what really matters 💪. This project is a small but meaningful step towards better productivity and time management. ⏳✨

✨ Features
🚫 Blocks Access to YouTube — Say goodbye to endless scrolling!
🛠️ Automated Tasks — Helps you manage distractions seamlessly.
📚 Learning by Doing — Explores Git, GitHub, and task scheduling.
🛤️ Journey So Far
Here’s what we’ve done to bring this idea to life:

1. Project Setup 🗂️
Created a main folder called fun_project.
Inside it, created a subfolder named scripts.
Decided to manage the entire process from VS Code. ✍️

2. Writing the Python Library 🐍
Wrote a Python script to block YouTube by editing the system’s hosts file:
Added an entry like this:
'''
127.0.0.1 youtube.com
'''
This redirects YouTube requests to the local machine, effectively blocking the site.
Packaged the script into a reusable Python library.
Added proper error handling and configuration options for customization.
Tested the library to ensure it blocks and unblocks YouTube seamlessly. ✅

3. Task Scheduling with Python 📆
Integrated task scheduling into the library using the schedule module:
Installed the library:
'''
pip install schedule
'''
Created a Python script to block and unblock YouTube at specific times:
'''
import schedule
import time
from youtube_close import block_youtube, unblock_youtube

def block_task():
    block_youtube()
    print("YouTube is now blocked. 🚫")

def unblock_task():
    unblock_youtube()
    print("YouTube is now unblocked. ✅")

# Schedule the blocking and unblocking
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(block_task)  # Block at 9:00 AM
schedule.every().day.at("17:00").do(unblock_task)  # Unblock at 5:00 PM

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
'''
Tested the scheduler to ensure tasks run at the correct times. 🕒


Here's a revised version of your README.md describing your Python library and the use of task scheduling with detailed steps:

📚 YouTube Close Project
🚀 Introduction
I was feeling distracted 😵‍💫, so I decided to channel that energy into creating something productive: a Python library 🎉 that helps manage distractions by blocking YouTube! This project uses task scheduling to automatically block access during specific times, ensuring better focus and productivity. ⏳✨

✨ Features
🛠️ Python Library — Custom-built to simplify distraction management.
🕒 Task Scheduling — Automates YouTube blocking based on pre-defined schedules.
🚫 Boost Focus — Helps avoid procrastination and stay on track.
🛤️ Journey So Far
Here’s the step-by-step process of how we made this happen:

1. Project Setup 🗂️
Created a folder named fun_project as the base for all experiments.
Inside it, added a subfolder called youtube_close for this project.

2. Writing the Python Library 🐍
Wrote a Python script to block YouTube by editing the system’s hosts file:
Added an entry like this:
Copy code
127.0.0.1 youtube.com
This redirects YouTube requests to the local machine, effectively blocking the site.
Packaged the script into a reusable Python library.
Added proper error handling and configuration options for customization.
Tested the library to ensure it blocks and unblocks YouTube seamlessly. ✅

3. Task Scheduling with Python 📆
Integrated task scheduling into the library using the schedule module:
Installed the library:
bash
Copy code
pip install schedule
Created a Python script to block and unblock YouTube at specific times:
python
Copy code
import schedule
import time
from youtube_close import block_youtube, unblock_youtube

def block_task():
    block_youtube()
    print("YouTube is now blocked. 🚫")

def unblock_task():
    unblock_youtube()
    print("YouTube is now unblocked. ✅")

# Schedule the blocking and unblocking
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(block_task)  # Block at 9:00 AM
schedule.every().day.at("17:00").do(unblock_task)  # Unblock at 5:00 PM

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(1)
Tested the scheduler to ensure tasks run at the correct times. 🕒

4. Version Control with Git 🐙
Initialized the repository and tracked changes using Git:
'''
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for YouTube blocking library"
'''
Created a remote repository on GitHub and pushed the project:
'''
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin main
'''

5. Enhanced the README 📝
Documented the process step-by-step to help others understand and replicate the solution. 🎨
